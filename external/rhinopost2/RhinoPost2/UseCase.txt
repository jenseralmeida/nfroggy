We are testing shopping cart component with next properties:
a) UserId - represents the id of the shopping cart user 
b) CartAmount - represents the total amount to be charged to user for shoosen cart items 

Shopping cart uses components implementing:
a) IUserRepository 
	- to retreive the user from database. 
	- to store the successfult payment amount into the payment history
	User type has properties: Name, Age, Bank account number
b) IPaymentProcessor duties
	- to check the state of users bank account 
	- to make payment from use rbank account
	- to raise an event once transaction would be completed successfully

We need to test that:
1) In case user repository couldn't find an user for a given user id, 
	cart should throw argument exception
2) In case user is having less money on account then the cart value, 
	the payment method should not be called 
	and the cart amount should stay unchanged
3) In case payment attempt would failed due to time out, 
	cart component should recover gracefully and 
	the cart value should stay untouched
4) We need to verify that the performance is optimal by 
	verifying that the retreiving of user data occured only once
5) We need to verify that once payment processor raised an event 
	and signalized that the payment is completed 
	the cart value would be reset to zero and
	the user repository would add that payment to payment history
