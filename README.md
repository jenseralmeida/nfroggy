Toy project for learn TDD, DDD, Rhino Mocks and IoC.

The central ideia of all API is:

  * be simple, but be util and
  * let me be complicated if I want.

To validations, the purpose is develop a simple but powerful interface to simple validations but fully extensive to custom and more complex validations.

To data access, lets simplify the common, without cut the flexibility of ADO.NET

This project is made by 3 main funcionalities:
  * [Validator](doc/wiki/Validator.md)
  * [DbCommandUtil](doc/wiki/DataAccess.md)
  * [Scope](doc/wiki/DataAccess.md)

Got to the [Start](doc/wiki/Start.md) wiki page for more details of the API. Below is a diagram of one part of the project, the base [Validator](doc/wiki/Validator.md) tool.
